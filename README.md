# Godot-BeatKeeper
A plugin for Godot that adds a node called BeatKeeper (child of AudioStreamPlayer) that emits signals at beat intervals. You can set offset negative so that the beats trigger earlier, so that the game's hit notes can "approach" before the beat actually happens.

# Installation
Download the code & place the `addons` folder in your project folder (`res://`)


# Usage
- Place the BeatKeeper node in your tree and load it with your music
- Set the Tempo to your song's BPM 
- Select which beat intervals you would like it to emit
- Turn on [Audio Mode](#audio-mode) if you need it
- Call `play(float)` on the BeatKeeper node

Signals will be emitted with a `number : int` that tells you how many times that beat interval has been done so far in the song

Signals also emit a `exact_msec : float` arg which provides the exact time in msecs of when the beat was supposed to play
- This was created due to a limitation of this plugin; it checks only every frame (or physics tick) for if the time has passed, so there will be a marginal delay. This `exact_msec` argument should enable you to make adjustments (by comparing the msec arg to the current msec) to compensate for the delayed signal, resulting in, to the end user, no delay at all. This is primarily for visuals, but auditorily, you can play the sound starting at the difference between the exact msec that it was supposed to play and when you actually got the signal, though this will result in audio being slightly cut off at the beginning.

# Explanation of Variables

## Tempo
Set this to the song's BPM or Beats Per Minute

## Offset In Ms
In milliseconds, how much you want to delay (or speed up) the emission of signals.
Use cases being:
- The song does not actually start playing until 500ms into the file. Set `Offset In Ms` to `500`.
- I want a signal to be emitted 1 second earlier than the actual beat (e.g. creating a game's hit note early so that it can be seen a set time and approach the beat). Set `Offset In Ms` to `-1000`.
- The song does not actually start playing until 500ms into the file, but I want a signal to be emitted 1 second earlier than the actual beat. Set `Offset In Ms` to `-500` (500 + -1000 = -500)

## Processing Mode
Setting the scans to trigger on _physics_process instead may prove more stable results if physics FPS is forced high

## Audio Mode
If you want to have an AudioStreamPlayer play on a signal emission, you will need to turn on Audio Mode, which will allow the BeatKeeper node to emit the `_audio` signals. These are slightly offset by the percieved AudioServer delay and will make your AudioStreamPlayer play at the correct time instead of slightly later.
